# CredenceID – On-chain Reputation System for the Informal Economy

**CredenceID** is a decentralized identity and reputation system that allows gig workers, artisans, and informal traders in Africa to build trusted digital profiles using on-chain Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). These tokens represent completed tasks, client reviews, and work history.

### 🌍 Why It Matters
Over 80% of Africa's workforce is in the informal sector and lacks access to formal credit or jobs due to missing digital credentials. CredenceID empowers them to build trust, access jobs, and participate in the Web3 economy.
